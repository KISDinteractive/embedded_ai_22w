# Chapter 5 | Deep Learning

***Disclaimer:*** *This page offers supporting material for an Interaction Design course held at [KISD](https://kisd.de) in the winter term 2022/23. Visit the [landing page](https://github.com/KISDinteractive/fundamentals22w) of this course for more information.*

## 5.1 Context: the Third AI Boom

In the course we discussed the third AI boom, or – as some people call it – the "deep learning revolution". Details of the most prominent events of this period will not be added to this repo soon, but may be added later in the form of the presentation slides.

## 5.2 Neural Networks & Deep Learning

We then discussed what "deep learning" or "deep neural networks" actually means, and went through the main terms and hyperparameters needed to build and train neural networks. We did this by going through the steps of the sine wave Hello-World Jupyter Notebook example from Chapter 4.

## 5.3 Optimisation through iterative experimentation

To capture and understand the influence and interdependencies of the different hyperparameters, we adapted the [Jupyter Notebook] (src/HelloWorld-SineWave.ipynb) to produce reproducible results using a predefined seed for Keras. We also improved the visual representation of the training process and the results.
